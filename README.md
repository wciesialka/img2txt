Turn an image into "ASCII Art" using Braille Unicode characters.

## Preamble

As I write this section of my README, it is 11/6/2021. I worked on this project initially almost four years ago, in 2018. It was the first project I was proud of. However, looking at it on my GitHub pinned now brings me a great amount of shame. I no longer like how I handled this program. I violated (albiet at the time, unknowlingly) many software engineering philosophies, and incidentally followed many design anti-patterns. I decided in a energy-drink fueled haze that I would rewrite the entire program, base-up, to the best of my current ability. After this, I hope to create something I can once again be proud of. Then again, in three years time, I might just rewrite it again.
